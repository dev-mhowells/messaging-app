        <p>
          This project supports two types of users, teachers and students. The
          functionality for each user type differs, as does the display. While
          the teacherâ€™s console/ messenger is responsive, it is designed for
          desktop use. The student messenger has been designed for both desktop
          and mobile.
        </p>
        <p>
          The messenger is fully functional, meaning messages and audio uploads
          will persist until deleted on the back-end. However, please feel free
          to play around as much as you like! All messages are regularly
          cleared.
